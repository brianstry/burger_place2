# burger_place

The program is used too mark down burgers that have been made and eaten by the user.

The user can add burgers to the menu on the left which then can be consumed by clicking the button next too it.  The burger will then change to the right side of the screen which will allow to click a new button that will place it back on the left side to show that you would make it again.
